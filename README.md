# **EEG Decoding of Musical Preferences**

This repository contains all code, preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction modules, and machine learning/deep learning models developed for the thesis:

**“EEG Decoding of Musical Preferences Using Traditional Machine Learning and the SAOF-Augmented Deep Learning Framework.”**

The project uses the **Music-EEG Dataset** (20 subjects, 14-channel Emotiv EPOC+, 128 Hz) to predict listener music preferences from EEG signals.
Two experiments were conducted:

1. **Experiment 1 — Traditional ML with LOSO**
2. **Experiment 2 — SAOF (Systematic Augmented Operation Framework)**

The repository is organized for **full transparency and reproducibility**, including venv instructions, software requirements, and optional Docker support.

## 🎧 **Dataset**

The dataset is **not included** due to copyright restrictions.

Download from:
➡️ **[https://github.com/AdamosDA/Music-EEG](https://github.com/AdamosDA/Music-EEG)**

Place `.mat` files here:

```
data/raw_data/
```

Processed EEG generated by preprocessing scripts will be saved automatically into:

```
data/processed_data/
```

These folders are ignored in `.gitignore` to avoid uploading large datasets.

## 🧠 **Experiment Summaries**

### **Experiment 1 — Traditional Machine Learning (LOSO)**

* EEG segmented into epochs
* Comprehensive feature extraction (time-domain, frequency-domain, statistical features)
* Classification + regression tasks
* Models include:

  * SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression
  * Ridge, Lasso, RandomForestRegressor
* Evaluation:

  * **Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO)**
  * Accuracy, Precision/Recall/F1, RMSE, R²

---

### **Experiment 2 — SAOF (Systematic Augmented Operation Framework)**

A novel hybrid framework involving:

* Multi-window EEG slicing
* Feature augmentation
* Noise-enhanced data expansion
* PCA/Dimensionality transformation
* Deep learning models with improved generalization

Achieved:

* **81.8% binary classification accuracy**
* **68.2% cross-subject accuracy**
* Identified important EEG markers (T4, P3, P4, F7, gamma band)

## ⚙️ **Environment Setup**

### **1. Create & activate virtual environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### **2. Install dependencies**

(If you have SSL issues, see note below)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run smoke test**

```bash
python src/smoke_test.py
```

Expected output:

```
python: 3.10.x
All core imports OK
```

### ❗ If your machine has SSL download issues

Use:

```bash
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 **How to Run the Experiments**

### **A. Preprocessing**

```bash
python src/2_Data_preprocessing/preprocess.py
```

Outputs saved to `data/processed_data/`

---

### **B. Experiment 1: Traditional ML**

```bash
python src/3_Ml_Model_exp_1/run_experiment.py
```

This script:

* loads processed EEG
* extracts features
* trains ML models
* evaluates LOSO performance
* saves results to `results/exp1/`

---

### **C. Experiment 2: SAOF Experiment**

```bash
python src/4_SAOF_exp_2/run_saof_training.py
```

This script:

* performs SAOF augmentation
* trains deep learning model
* outputs classification & regression metrics
* saves results to `results/exp2/`

---
