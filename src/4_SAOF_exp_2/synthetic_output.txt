SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION SUMMARY
======================================================================
📊 Original dataset: 439 samples
📊 Synthetic dataset: 657 samples
📊 Augmentation ratio: 1.5x
📊 Additional samples: 218

🎯 Benefits of synthetic data:
   ✅ Increased training data for better ML performance
   ✅ Better class balance for classification
   ✅ Reduced overfitting risk
   ✅ More robust model training
   ✅ PCA visualization shows data distribution quality

🔄 Next steps:
   1. Use '/home/anower/All/Python/Thesis_VS_code/full_epoch/emon/eeg_features_full_synthetic.pkl' in your ML model
   2. Compare performance with original data
   3. Analyze which synthetic methods work best
   4. Review PCA visualization in '/home/anower/All/Python/Thesis_VS_code/full_epoch/emon/'

💡 Tips for ML model:
   • Update features_path to use synthetic data
   • Monitor for overfitting with larger dataset
   • Consider separate validation on original data only
   • Compare results with and without synthetic data
   • Use PCA plots to understand data quality and overlap
